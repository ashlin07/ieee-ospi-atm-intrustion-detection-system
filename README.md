# Intrusion Detection System for ATM Booths

This repository contains code for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed specifically for ATM booths. The system utilizes pose estimation and object detection techniques to detect anomalies and ensure the security of ATM users and their transactions.

## Features

- **Pose Estimation:** The system employs pose estimation algorithms to analyze the positions and movements of individuals within the ATM booth. It can identify suspicious postures or actions that may indicate unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.

- **Object Detection:** Object detection algorithms are utilized to identify objects within the ATM booth. This helps in recognizing potentially dangerous or forbidden items, such as weapons or skimming devices, that could compromise the security of the ATM.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the ATM environment in real-time, enabling prompt detection of anomalies or suspicious activities.

- **Alert Notifications:** In the event of an anomaly or the presence of a suspicious object, the system sends alert notifications to the user or relevant security personnel. This allows for quick response and appropriate action to be taken.
